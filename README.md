# cityImage

**A tool for analysing urban legibility and extracting The Computational Image of the City**

## Introduction

This repository provides a set of functions to extract salient urban features in line with the definitions laid down by Kevin Lynch in [The Image of The City](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/image-city) using open and freely available geospatial datasets.

The tools are written in Python and uses a series of libraries, including [Geopandas](http://geopandas.org), [OSMNx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and related dependencies.

The methods are fully documented in *A Computational approach to ‘The Image of the City’* by Filomena, Verstegen, and Manley, published in [Cities](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.01.006).
